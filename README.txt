This is a student project at the [Free university of Tbilisi](http://www.freeuni.edu.ge/en). 
The goal of the project is to create UML documentation of GoF design patterns using PlauntUML.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is forked from from [massix/Design-Patterns](https://github.com/massix/Design-Patterns).
Most of the code is taken from the book "GoF's Design Patterns in Java" by "Franco Guidi Polanco", which
may be freely downloaded at: (http://eii.ucv.cl/pers/guidi/designpatterns.htm).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Following patterns:
* Visitor
* Template Method
* Strategy
* State
* Observer
* Memento
* Factory Method
